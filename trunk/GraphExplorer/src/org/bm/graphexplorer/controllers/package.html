        Contains code for managing a graph, including decor, filtering, statistics, etc.
        This code should not depend on any other packages, allowing it to be reusable elsewhere.
        This requirement includes all swing/GUI elements other than the graph components;
        other views will receive updates via <code>PropertyChangeEvent</code>s.
