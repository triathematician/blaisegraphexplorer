= File Formats in GraphExplorer =
In the GraphExplorer interface, file formats are determined by the selection of file type in the load/save file dialog. Several different file formats for graphs are supported:
* EdgeListFormat
* PajekFormat
* UCINetFormat
* GraphMLFormat
* DyNetMLFormat

_NOTE:_ "edge" denotes an undirected edge in a graph, while "arc" denotes a directed edge.
