= File Formats in GraphExplorer =
In the GraphExplorer interface, file formats are determined by the selection of file type in the load/save file dialog. Several different file formats for graphs are supported:
 * [EdgeListFormat Edge List (.txt)]
 * [PajekFormat Pajek (.net)]
 * [UCINetFormat UCINet (.dat)]
 * [GraphMLFormat GraphML (.xml, .graphml)]
 * [DyNetMLFormat DyNetML (.xml, .dynetml)]

_NOTE:_ "edge" denotes an undirected edge in a graph, while "arc" denotes a directed edge.
