# File Formats in GraphExplorer #
In the GraphExplorer interface, file formats are determined by the selection of file type in the load/save file dialog. Several different file formats for graphs are supported:
  * [Edge List (.txt)](EdgeListFormat.md)
  * [Pajek (.net)](PajekFormat.md)
  * [UCINet (.dat)](UCINetFormat.md)
  * [GraphML (.xml, .graphml)](GraphMLFormat.md)
  * [DyNetML (.xml, .dynetml)](DyNetMLFormat.md)

_NOTE:_ "edge" denotes an undirected edge in a graph, while "arc" denotes a directed edge.
