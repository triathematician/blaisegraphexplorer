# Quick Start #
GraphExplorer is built to help you get started exploring graphs right away. The following tutorial describes a few basic steps to get you started.

## Step 1. Generate a Graph ##
Choose an option under the `File >> Create` menu to generate a specified or random graph. The "Uniform (Erdos-Renyi) random graph" option is a good choice.

## Step 2. Apply a Layout ##
Click the green "start" button on the toolbar, or hit `Alt+A` to layout the nodes in the graph using a force-directed algorithm. Hit `Alt+S` or the stop button to stop the layout once it looks right.

## Step 3. Choose a Metric ##
In the chooser next to the "`Node metric:`" label, select the `Degree` metric. This weights the size of displayed nodes by degree, and also updates the **Metric Plot** view with the degree distribution.

## Step 4. Modify Appearance ##
Use the property tables on the lefthand side of the display to modify the appearance of the graph.

# Next Steps #
Next steps to take:
  * Try out different graph generation methods, or different metrics.
  * Load an existing graph from a file. See GraphFileFormats for descriptions of the various supported formats. This also provides an easy way to describe your own graph to load into GraphExplorer.
  * Try out some of the features for DynamicGraphs.
